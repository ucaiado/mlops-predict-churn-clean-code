Predict Customer Churn with Clean Code
================


This project is part of the [ ML DevOps Engineer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/machine-learning-dev-ops-engineer-nanodegree--nd0821)
 program from Udacity. I develop a traffic simulation in which vehicles move
 along streets and cross intersections. Each intersection will be equipped with
 a traffic light. I built a suitable and thread-safe communication protocol
 between vehicles and intersections to complete the simulation.
