Predict Customer Churn with Clean Code
================


This project is part of the [ ML DevOps Engineer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/machine-learning-dev-ops-engineer-nanodegree--nd0821)
 program from Udacity. I developed a model to identify credit card customers
 that are most likely to churn, following coding (PEP8) and engineering best
 practices for implementing software (modular, documented, and tested) and the
 package also have the flexibility of being run interactively or from the
 command-line interface (CLI).
